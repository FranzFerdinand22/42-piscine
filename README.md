# 42Prague - Piscine (November 2022)

### What means piscine?:

„Piscine“ it’s the French word for „Swimming Pool“. The idea is that everyone learns how to swim by immediately jumping into the water.In 42 believes it’s the same when you start programming.

### About piscine:

The Piscine is a 4-weeks immersive training on campus taht brings together about 150 other candidates to spend 4 weeks, seven days a week, day and night (including weekends) . 
Dive deep into coding with C and Unix by working through challenging projects and solving daily assignments alongside your peers.

### Projects:

- **[C00](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C00)**: Introduction to C

- **[C01](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C01)**: Pointers and If Statements

- **[C02](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C02)**: Introduction To Strings and Arrays

- **[C03](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C03)**: String Functions, Manipulation and Concatanation

- **[C04](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C04)**: Analysing String Qualities and Manipulating Ints

- **[C05](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C05)**: Mathematical Concepts in C

- **[C06](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C06)**: Understanding Argc and Argv

- **[C07](https://github.com/FranzFerdinand22/42-piscine/tree/main/C07)**: Memory Allocation



### Developed skills:

**hard skills**:
```
# C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

# Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

# Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
```

**soft skills**:
```
# Self-learning and proactiveness
	At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
	are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
	your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

# Teamwork
	On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
	chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
	The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
	common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

# Time management and resiliency
	The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
	they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
	"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
